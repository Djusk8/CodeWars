Array.diff

Your goal in this kata is to implement a difference function, which subtracts one list from another and returns the result.

It should remove all values from list a, which are present in list b.

array_diff([1,2],[1]) == [2]

If a value is present in b, all of its occurrences must be removed from the other:

array_diff([1,2,2,2,3],[2]) == [1,3]

# ---------------  SOLUTION ---------------
import codewars_test as Test


def array_diff(a, b):
    for x in b:
        while x in a:
            a.remove(x)

    return a
